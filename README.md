### W209 - Assignment -2 

In this assignment I visualize my google search activity over the last 2-3 years. I think this is a proxy of how much I was working over the last few years and the changes in the trend over the period.

I use the calendar heatmap to do that. The visualization shows a heatmap of calendar dates with a count of google searches that I did on that day.
